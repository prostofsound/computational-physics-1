    "\n",
    "### Coding tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Create a python function that reads $n$, $T$, $V$, $a$, $b$ and returns a two-element tuple with the thermal pressures $P$, calculated with the ideal gas equation and the van der Waals equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Define a python dictionary containing the identifiers of all 6 gases as \"keys\" with their respective $a$ and $b$ constants as elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pressure-Volume (PV) plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Generate a 1D volume vector covering the range from $0.5$ to $5\\,\\rm L$, and fix the number of moles at $n=1\\,\\rm mol$ and the temperature of the gas at $T=298\\,\\rm K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Using the values of $a$ and $b$ from the dictionary in point (b), and the inputs in defined (c), call the function created in point (a) to obtain a set of pressure arrays, $P$, with both equations of state for each gas. (**Hint:** a for loop can help access the dictionary elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Use matplotlib to make a high-quality, labeled, multi-panel figure of the thermal pressure (calculated with both EOS) of all 6 gases as a function of volume. The plot should have $P$ on the Y axis and $V$ on the X axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temperature surfaces on the PV plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Now, we want to represent the gas temperature surfaces on the PV plane. Create a new python function that reads $n$, $P$, $V$, $a$, $b$ and returns a two-element tuple with the temperatures $T$, calculated with the ideal gas equation and the van der Waals equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Create a 2D pressure-volume (PV) meshgrid using appropriate vectors for thermal pressures and volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(h)** Use matplotlib to make two high-quality, labeled, multi-panel figures of the 2D temperatures (calculated with both EOS) of all 6 gases as a function of volume. The first figure should show 3D visualisations of the temperature surface. The second figure should show 2D projections of the temperature surface onto the PV plane. All the plots should have $P$ on the Y axis, $V$ on the X axis, and $T$ on the Z axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** Briefly explain, what do the the $a$ and $b$ constants in the real gas EOS represent physically?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(j)** Based on the figures you made, what differences do you see between ideal and real gases? When do they coincide or differ?\n"

    "## 2. Period of the tide using sea level data (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to calculate the period of the sea level change with the tide in Ecuador. For this, we are going to use sea level measurements from the data base of the University of Hawaii: \n",
    "\n",
    "http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/?fd\n",
    "\n",
    "These data sets were collected from more than $500$ tide gauge stations across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reference: Caldwell, P. C., M. A. Merrifield, P. R. Thompson (2015), Sea level measured by tide gauges from global oceans â€” the Joint Archive for Sea Level holdings (NCEI Accession 0019568), Version 5.5, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, Dataset, doi:10.7289/V5V40S7W.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python I/O:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Go to the website of the sea level database and search for measurments from Ecuador. Download the \"Research Quality\" \"hourly\" data for all three stations in Ecuador (Santa Cruz, Baltra, and La Libertad). Inspect the data file structure. These data sets are **csv** files with 5 columns each (year, month, day, hour, sea level). The units of the sea level data are $\\rm mm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Create an I/O function that uses pandas to read in the data from these files and return the columns as numpy arrays. You will use the hour and sea level columns for the analysis below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Plot the sea level measurements against the hours for all stations for a first inspection. You will notice there are outliers. Outliers show up as negative values that occur when instruments fail or measurements are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing and clean-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Create a clean-up function that removes extreme outliers from the data using indexing. Plot again the sea level measurements against the hours for all stations, but using the cleaned-up data wihtout outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression and goodness-of-fit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Calculate the average sea level at each hour for Santa Cruz and make a plot of average sea level against hours. Based on the observed trend, propose a model to describe the tide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Fit your model to the data to study the hourly change of the sea level also known as the tide (if you use curvefit() for the regression, I suggest providing ansatz values). Report the best-fit function including uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Carry out a goodness-of-fit test. For this you need a function that computes the global $\\chi^2$ statistic, the number of degrees of freedom, and the reduced $\\chi^2$ statistic. Use your function to evaluate your regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(h)** Construct the confidence intervals and show them in 2D parameter space/s. For this you should evaluate the $\\chi^2$ statistic in the vicinity of the best-fit values for the free parameters in your model. The confidence interval maps should have one free parameter in the X axis, another free parameter in the Y axis, and the projected $\\chi^2$ hypersurface in the $Z$ axis. **Hints:** to create a 2D parameter space as a meshgrid, you should first create vectors with numbers around the best-fit values found in your regressions. 1D plots showing $\\chi^2$ as a function of each free parameter may help identify optimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** Based on the fitted function, what period does the tide in Santa Cruz have? What do the confidence intervals tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(j)** Can the same model be applied to the other 2 stations (Baltra and La Libertad)? If not, report appropriate best-fit functions for these stations too."
